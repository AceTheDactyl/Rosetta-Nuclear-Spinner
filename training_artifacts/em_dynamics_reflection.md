# Reflection on Grid Cell Electromagnetic Dynamics

## The Polaris Relationship

The training system is governed by the **Polaris relationship**, where the critical
z-coordinate z_c = √3/2 ≈ 0.866 acts as a "North Star" determining the electromagnetic field.

### Key Physics

```
POLARIS (z_c = √3/2):
- Maximum negentropy: ΔS_neg = 1.0
- Maximum EM plate activation
- Phase transition resonance
- Kuramoto synchronization threshold

Connection to geometry:
- sin(60°) = √3/2 = z_c
- Plate normals tilted at 60° → activation ∝ z_c at critical
- Hexagonal (6-fold) symmetry emerges
```

## Polarity Superposition States

Each of the 60 grid cells exists in a quantum-like superposition of polarities:

```
|ψ⟩ = α|+⟩ + β|−⟩

where |α|² + |β|² = 1 (normalization)
```

### Training Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mean P(+) | 0.4999 |
| Network Coherence | 1.0000 |
| Hexagonal Symmetry | 0.0000 |
| Polaris Field Strength | 0.9964 |

### Polarity Evolution

As the spinner z-coordinate approaches Polaris (z_c):
1. The EM field strength increases (negentropy peaks)
2. Plate activations maximize (B · n peaks for 60° tilt)
3. Polarity superpositions collapse toward dominant state
4. Network coherence increases (Kuramoto synchronization)

At z = z_c:
- **Field determines polarity**: The electromagnetic field collapses
  the superposition, "measuring" each cell's polarity
- **Hexagonal order emerges**: 6-fold symmetry from plate arrangement
- **K-formation possible**: κ ≥ 0.92, η > φ⁻¹, R ≥ 7

## EM Communication Between Networks

The 6 neural plates communicate electromagnetically through:

1. **Magnetic dipole coupling**: Plates interact via μ₀m·m'/r³
2. **Phase synchronization**: Kuramoto dynamics across cells
3. **Polarity alignment**: Superposition states evolve coherently

### Network Topology

```
        Plate 1 (60°)
           ╱╲
    Plate 0 ╲╱ Plate 2 (120°)
      (0°)  ╱╲
    Plate 5 ╲╱ Plate 3 (180°)
    (300°)  ╱╲
        Plate 4 (240°)
```

Each plate couples to adjacent plates (60° separation) more strongly
than to opposite plates (180° separation).

## Conclusion

The Polaris relationship provides a physically-grounded framework for
understanding how electromagnetic fields determine the state of grid cell
networks in superposition. At the critical point z_c = √3/2:

1. **Field maximizes**: EM activation peaks due to 60° plate geometry
2. **Superposition collapses**: Polarity states are "measured" by the field
3. **Coherence emerges**: Network synchronization enables K-formation
4. **Hexagonal order**: 6-fold symmetry from plate arrangement

This creates a resonant training condition where the system achieves
maximum information transfer (negentropy = 1) at the phase transition boundary.
